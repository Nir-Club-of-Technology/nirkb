# Nirkb
A knowledge base which takes the nature of mathematics in mind and supports executable content.

- Organisation of knowledge reflects the nature of mathematics and can boost mathematical creativity.
- Knowledge is executable. Run the code or everything that produces your results.
- Computer-aided mathematics: Integrate mathematical software systems.
- Assist your mathematical research in every phase of your workflow: from ideas to experiments, to publishing.
- Collaborate in a distributed way. Every one has their own aspects of knowledge and can swiftly merge with others.

## The Nature of Mathematics

Mathematics can be understand as a tower of abstract rooted in the real world [1].

A _theory_ is a certain, focus, systematic, abstract view of both the real and abstract worlds. 
It illustrate the principles of a collection of related objects and their interactions.
_You could also consider a theory as a sub-world_.
